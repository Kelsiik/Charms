<P> It's also a quality of being attractive and pleasing. To charm someone is to attract them. There are several types of charms, but they mostly relate to attraction and good luck.
<P> The wearing of charms may have begun as a form of amulet or talisman to ward off evil spirits or bad luck. During the pre-historic period, jewellery charms would be made from shells, animal-bones and clay. Later charms were made out of gems, rocks, and wood.
<P> One of the main reasons why charm jewellery is still so popular is because of the fact that there is usually a special sentimental story associated with each and every charm.
